# User Initializers

The `user` package contains modules for generating user-specific data profiles and initializing Redis data.

## Modules

### `ProfileGenerators`

This module is responsible for generating various synthetic data profiles. These profiles can simulate user behavior, such as EV consumption, water heater usage, and more.

### `redis_data_initializer`

This module takes the generated user-specific data profiles and initializes the Redis database with them. This is useful for populating the system with initial user data for testing and development.

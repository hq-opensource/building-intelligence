# HA Device Interface

The `ha-device-interface` package serves as the primary service for interacting with smart home devices, particularly those integrated with Home Assistant. It provides a streamlined interface for controlling various devices by abstracting the underlying communication protocols.

## Key Components

This package is composed of several key components that work together to provide a robust and extensible device control system:

- **`app.py`**: The main entry point for the application. It initializes the FastStream application, configures the Redis broker for messaging, and incorporates the necessary routers to handle device control requests.

- **`control` Subpackage**: This subpackage contains the core logic for device control.
  - **`control/interface.py`**: Defines the `DeviceInterface`, an abstract base class that establishes a contract for all device control implementations. It also includes concrete implementations such as `HomeAssistantDeviceInterface` for communicating with the Home Assistant API and `MockDeviceInterface` for testing purposes.
  - **`control/subscriber.py`**: Implements a Redis subscriber that listens for `get` and `set` commands on dedicated channels. It dynamically instantiates the appropriate device interface based on the application's configuration and delegates the control requests accordingly.

By leveraging this modular architecture, the `ha-device-interface` package offers a flexible solution for managing and controlling smart home devices in a variety of environments.

"""
The `data_engine.database` package provides a suite of modules for robust interaction
with various database systems, primarily focusing on InfluxDB for time-series data
and Redis for caching and configuration management. These modules are essential for
the data engine's core operations, ensuring efficient data retrieval, storage, and
synchronization.

Modules:
- `influx_mirror.py`: Implements the `InfluxMirror` class, which is responsible for
  synchronizing time-series data from a remote InfluxDB Cloud instance to a local
  InfluxDB server. This module handles the fetching of measurements, fields, and
  historical data, providing a reliable mechanism for data replication.

- `RetrieveDataForCloud.py`: Features the `RetrieveDataForCloud` class, designed to
  fetch and organize real-time measurement data from InfluxDB. It prepares the data
  for cloud consumption by structuring it for telemetry, handling potential data gaps,
  and ensuring the data is in a suitable format for upstream services.

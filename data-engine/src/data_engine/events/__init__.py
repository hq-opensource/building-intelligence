"""
The `data_engine.events` package is responsible for handling event-driven communication
within the data engine. It provides modules that manage asynchronous interactions,
such as handling RPC (Remote Procedure Call) requests and responses, which are crucial
for the distributed nature of the system.

Modules:
- `forecaster_rpc_answer.py`: This module is dedicated to managing forecast-related
  RPCs. It subscribes to forecast request topics, processes incoming messages, and
  coordinates the retrieval of cached or newly computed forecasts. The module
  integrates with InfluxDB for data retrieval and Redis for caching and message
  brokering, ensuring efficient and reliable forecast delivery.
